# Resources found for Video Captioning

### VideoBERT: A Joint Model for Video and Language Representation Learning(Tried and fixed all the errors)

# Arcitecture  -
1. using BERT model of masking the text as well as video tokens.
2. video tokens were finded by using the kinetics dataset and then converted with bert tokenizer.
3. sentence tokens were the captions
4. task which it performed was to find the verbs and nouns given some selected video frames.
5. Video frames were selected on the basis of clustering

Problem - Code for conversion of video to the required format(No clue Given)

###  Describing Videos by Exploiting Temporal Structure(Tried and fixed a lot of errors but still some are remaining)

# Architecture -
1. Exploiting temporal attention network using features from different pre trained models like ResNet
2. Using RNN's for text

Problem - Daily Quota exhausted

Problem - Easy to run but still no idea about the inferencing part. I would try again at 3 PM on 10-08-2020
